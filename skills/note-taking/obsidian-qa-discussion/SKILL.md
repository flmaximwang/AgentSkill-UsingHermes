# Recording Q&A Discussions into Obsidian

When the user asks a series of deep "why" questions on a technical topic and then asks to save the discussion into the Obsidian vault.

## Trigger

User asks to save a technical discussion into the Obsidian vault. **Two distinct trigger patterns produce different output formats:**

| Trigger phrasing | Expected output format |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| "把讨论记录/归纳总结到 Obsidian" / "存成笔记" | **Q&A transcript** — numbered sections matching the reasoning chain |
| "先整理一下" / "把这个内容整理成笔记" / simply "整理" | **Knowledge reference note** — encyclopedia-style sections (definition, mechanism, experiments, applications, etc.), NOT a dialog replay |

**Key distinction**: "整理" implies the user wants a polished, reusable reference — not a verbatim record of the conversation flow. Reading "整理一下" and writing a Q&A transcript is a mistake.

## Workflow

### Phase 0: Determine note type from trigger

Before anything else, classify the user's request:

- **"整理一下" / "整理成笔记"** → Knowledge reference note. Skip Phase 1's Q&A-specific advice and go straight to Phase 2 (CLC classification). Structure as an encyclopedia article, not a dialog transcript.
- **"把讨论记录到 Obsidian" / "记录讨论"** → Q&A transcript. Follow the full workflow including Phase 1's structured answer pattern.

### Phase 1: Provide structured answers during discussion

When the user asks a chain of deep questions:

- Start with the **core principle**, then build upward
- Use **comparison tables** and **math formulas** when relevant
- Trace back to **first principles** (user's learning style: they ask "why" recursively)
- Offer to show a **real image/visual aid** when one exists

### Phase 1b: Deep explanatory techniques for "why" chains

When the user follows up a first answer with deeper "why" questions (e.g., "热压为什么是向内的", "辐射压究竟是什么"), use multi-level layered answers:

- **Multi-level explanation**: Give the SAME phenomenon at different abstraction layers — phenomenological formula (what), field-theoretic definition (how), microscopic mechanism (why). Example for "radiation pressure": (1) P~2I/c from photon momentum, (2) Maxwell stress tensor ⟨T_rr⟩, (3) ponderomotive force F_p∝-∇E². This satisfies the "why → why → why" chain without repeating yourself.

- **Energy budget reasoning**: Use back-of-envelope calculations when a claim seems counterintuitive ("why doesn't it explode?" → show P_th ∝ R⁻⁵ scaling). This builds trust through quantitative intuition.

- **Geometrical ASCII diagrams**: Draw the system's force balance in ASCII (spherical shell, arrows for inward/outward forces) when spatial reasoning is essential. This resolves confusion faster than prose alone.

- **Historical evidence timeline**: When asked "how did scientists figure this out," present a chronological evidence chain (1955 Kapitza → 1969 Dawson & Jones → 1990s PIC → 2014 spectrum → 2016 Wu → 2026 SIOM). This gives the answer narrative structure and shows convergence from multiple independent lines.

- **Analogy to familiar systems**: Compare to well-understood systems (stars, soap bubbles, balloons, tokamaks) when explaining force balance, but always note where the analogy breaks.

- **Fiction-vs-science comparison**: When the user asks about a fictional representation (Liu Cixin's macro electron, etc.), present a side-by-side comparison table and evaluate the fiction on scientific grounds. This both satisfies curiosity and reinforces the correct physics.

> See `references/electromagnetic-soliton-deep-dive.md` for a worked example of all six techniques on a single "why" chain.

### Phase 1b: Deep follow-up Q&A after note creation

When the user continues asking deep "why" questions AFTER the note has already been created (knowledge-reference or Q&A):

- **Answer the question in chat first, then offer the note update.** A follow-up phrased as a question is a request for an answer, not a licence to edit the note — write the full answer, then ask whether to record it, and edit only once the user says so.
- Assess whether the new material warrants a **note update**: did the follow-up uncover significantly missing content (e.g. a key mechanism not explained), or was it just elaboration on what's already covered?
- If update warranted → append new sections or enrich existing ones. Use `patch` for targeted insertions.
- If update not warranted → offer to save separately or note in your reply that the content is covered already.
- **Don't update if it's just a deeper explanation of already-documented points** — the user may be using the existing note as a reference while learning, not asking for expansion.

### Phase 2: Locate the CLC classification

Before writing to Obsidian:

1. Search the vault's `🗂️ Classifications/` for existing notes on the topic
2. Search for CLC-code folder names (e.g., `O657.33`, `TP18`)
3. Check `<vault_root>/README.md` for CLC rules
4. Search the web (clcindex.com) if the code is uncertain

**Key rule**: CLC subclasses are FLAT at the `🗂️ Classifications/` root.

### Phase 3: Structure the note

**Two format branches** — choose based on Phase 0:

#### Branch A: Q&A transcript format

```markdown
---
aliases: Topic Keywords
tags: 
date created: YYYY-MM-DD
---

# Topic Title

Brief context paragraph.

## 1️⃣ First question/theme

Core answer with key insight. Use comparison tables when applicable.

## 2️⃣ Next question/theme

...

## Summary

Concluding comparison table or one-paragraph synthesis.

## 相关笔记

- [[Existing Note 1]]
```

#### Branch B: Knowledge reference note format (from "整理一下")

```markdown
---
aliases: [别称, English]
tags: [Memos/Physics (or appropriate domain tag)]
parents: [[Parent CLC Folder]]
abstract: One-sentence summary of the concept.
keywords: [keyword1, keyword2]
---

# Title

## 背景

Lay the foundation — what broader context this concept fits into.

## 定义

Precise definition with boundary conditions.

## 产生机制 / 工作原理

Break down the physics/mechanism step by step. Use comparison tables, math formulas.

## 关键实验 / 证据

If recent experimental results exist, summarize in a table: parameters, values, significance.

## 应用前景 / 与用户领域的关联

What's the practical relevance? Explicitly note if there is **no direct connection** to the user's domain (protein design, biochemistry).

## 参考文献

- Source papers, news releases, DOI links

## 相关笔记

- [[Existing Note 1]]
```

**Key differences from Q&A format**:
- Frontmatter includes `abstract` and `keywords` fields
- Sections are thematic (Background / Definition / Mechanism / Evidence), not dialog-sequence-based
- "Related to your field" section is labeled explicitly, including a clear "no connection" statement when warranted
- Each section is self-contained — the note should be understandable without reading the conversation history
- **Source-derived notes (a book chapter or paper)**: cite the source page on every claim (e.g. `(Equation 8, p.20)`), and mark anything you *derived* rather than transcribed as explicitly not-in-source (e.g. `（★ 非书中原印）`) — the user audits derived formulas against the source. When the source contradicts itself (a caption that disagrees with its own appendix derivation, stated constants that cannot reproduce the drawn curves), record the discrepancy in a `> [!warning]` callout rather than silently picking one side.
- **Science Q&A additions (Branch B)**: if the original question was poorly posed, include an explicit "澄清后的核心问题" section (why the original is flawed + the reframed version) as the note's first content section; when evidence strength varies across the table, add a one-line evidence legend (e.g. ★★★ direct causal / ★★ functional / ★ correlative) above the comparison table. Match the vault's existing note conventions (e.g. `RNA.md`-style minimal frontmatter: aliases + dates) when placing a concept note inside an established CLC subtree — don't force the full template.

### Phase 4: Handle media

**Downloaded images:**

1. Search for a public-domain or freely licensed image (Wikimedia Commons, etc.)
2. Download it to the **same directory as the note** (use PNG format)
3. Reference it with `![[filename.png]]` — or, when the note lives in its own folder, put figures in that folder's `assets/` and embed `![[assets/<name>.png]]` (the subtopic-folder convention this vault already uses)
4. **Fallback**: Wikimedia CDN may block curl — try the `thumb/...` PNG preview URL or use a browser screenshot

**Figures you generate yourself — the script is part of the record.** The user asks for the generating script explicitly; a figure with no script is not reproducible and cannot be corrected later. Layout:

```
<Note folder>/
├── <Note>.md          ← embeds ![[assets/<name>.png]]
├── assets/*.png       ← the figures
└── scripts/*.py       ← the scripts that produce them
```

- **Output path relative to the script, never `/tmp`**: `OUT = Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent / "assets"`, then `OUT.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)`. A stored script that writes to `/tmp` cannot re-run in place and silently diverges from the images in the note.
- **The docstring header carries the exact run command and the interpreter that actually has the dependency** — a future session should not have to rediscover which python has the library.
- **Run it from inside the note folder after every edit** and confirm the PNG's mtime/size changed before embedding.
- Chart labels, axis text and table headers in **English** even when the note prose is Chinese (standing user convention).
- **Look at every figure before embedding it**: render, then read the PNG back with `vision_analyze` using a *directed* question ("do the two bracket labels overlap each other or the curve; is anything clipped at the edges?") — an open "does this look okay?" returns reassurance and misses the defects. One pass usually reveals at least one overlap; two passes is normal.
- **Figures lifted from a source PDF**: `pdftotext` interleaves and reorders the text *inside* figures, so extract body text normally but render each figure page to an image (`pdftoppm -r 300 -f N -l N`) and read the panel labels with `vision_analyze`. Never infer a curve's axis label, intercept annotation or tick values from the extracted text stream.

### Phase 5: Update cross-links

1. **Backup first** — `cp target.md target.md.bak` before any edit
2. **Folder note** — add `[[New Note]]` to the folder's root `.md` file
3. **Parent/related notes** — add `[[New Note]]` to directly related subtopic notes
4. Use `patch` for targeted edits

### Phase 6: Verify — programmatically, not by eyeballing

Run `scripts/verify-note-edit.py <vault_root> <note.md> <note.md.bak-YYYYMMDD>`. It performs all four checks below and prints one line per item:

1. **YAML frontmatter parses.**
2. **Line-set diff against the backup.** Compute the lines present in the backup but absent from the new text and *read the list*. An intentionally rewritten line (a corrected heading, a reworded claim) legitimately disappears, so a bare "all original lines still present" check goes False and cannot distinguish a deliberate edit from silent data loss. The rule is: **every missing line must be one you meant to remove.**
3. **Every `[[wikilink]]` resolves** to a real `.md` in the vault.
4. **Every `![[embed]]` resolves on the filesystem** — test both `<note folder>/<embed>` and `<vault>/<embed>`, since Obsidian resolves either. Keep this separate from check 3: a resolver that globs `name + ".md"` reports every `![[assets/x.png]]` as broken, and an asset path is not a note name.

Also `ls` the note directory to confirm `assets/` and `scripts/` actually landed, and re-run the stored script to confirm the figures regenerate.

## Format conventions (user preferences)

### Branch A: Q&A transcript format

| Element | Convention |
|---------|-----------|
| Sections | Numbered with emoji: `## 1️⃣`, `## 2️⃣` |
| Comparisons | Side-by-side tables with clear column headers |
| Math | $$ LaTeX $$ for formulas |
| Key insights | Bold or callout blocks |
| Summary | Final comparison table wrapping up all points |
| Frontmatter | `aliases:`, `tags:`, `date created:` |
| Images | `![[filename.png]]` embed, placed in same directory (or `![[assets/filename.png]]` in a folder-based note) |

### Branch B: Knowledge reference note format

| Element | Convention |
|---------|-----------|
| Sections | Thematic headings (背景 / 定义 / 机制 / 关键实验 / 应用前景) |
| Frontmatter | `aliases:`, `tags:`, `parents:`, `abstract:`, `keywords:` |
| Field relevance | Explicit section — include "no direct connection" disclaimer when true |
| Comparisons | Tables with clear column headers |
| Math | $$ LaTeX $$ for formulas |
| Images | `![[filename.png]]` embed where available |
| References | Numbered or bulleted list with DOI links and news-report URLs |

## Pitfalls

- **Don't cram all Q&A into one mega-section** — each distinct question needs its own section
- **Don't write without checking vault first** — CLC code may already exist with related notes
- **Don't skip the image** — user values visual aids
- **Don't use SVG embeds** — not reliably rendered in Obsidian; convert to PNG
- **Don't forget .bak** — vault modifications need recovery options
- **Don't assume a CLC code** — always verify by searching the vault
- **Don't use Q&A transcript format when user says "整理一下"** — this is the most common mistake. "整理" demands a polished, self-contained reference note, not a dialog replay.
- **Don't create a knowledge note that requires conversation history to understand** — each section must be self-contained.
